I'm a senior undergraduate student in [Network Security Lab (NSLab)](https://www.nslab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/) at [Dept. of CSIE](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw//?locale=en), National Taiwan University, advised by [Prof. Hsu-Chun Hsiao](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~hchsiao/). Having studied directed fuzzing and formal aspects of symbolic execution, I'm currently shifting my research to other topics in the vast field of formal methods and program verification. In addition, I'm also a research assistant in [IIS, Academica Sinica](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/en/) supervised by [Prof. Bow-Yaw Wang](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~bywang/), focusing on verifying cryptographic programs.
